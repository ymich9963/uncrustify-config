# uncrustify-config
My config for Uncrustify.

Made for [Uncrustify 0.79.0](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) using the online [uncrustify_config](https://github.com/CDanU/uncrustify_config), and is based on the [ESP-IDF Style Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/contribute/style-guide.html) because I like that style.

`example.c` is one of my projects minified using [this](https://unminifyall.com/c-language/) online tool, and `example.c.uncrustify` is the result by running uncrustify.
